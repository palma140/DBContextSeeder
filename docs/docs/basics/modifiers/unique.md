# 🔒 Unique

Ensures all values generated for this column are unique.

---

## Example Usage

```php
use IPLeiria\ESTG\EI\DBContextSeeder\TableSeeder;

$seeder->email('email')->unique(); //tells faker that it should generate only unique emails
```
## ⚠️ Warning

The `unique` modifier might not be supported by all seeder types—particularly those that don't rely on Faker—or in new and custom implementations. Use it with caution and thoroughly test your seeders.
